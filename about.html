    <p>The railway reservation system is software for the purpose of reserving train seats at any time and from
        anywhere. This application provides us complete information about a train between specified source and
        destination. This application gives current status of reservations of particular train, fares for different
        classes of train and also waiting status. For this application, a visitor must register to avail the
        service. In this system, train records are maintained and retrieved. Administrator monitors all users and
        their transactions. Administrator has complete access to database and can add train or cancel train or add
        station for particular train or skip a station for train. There are several payment options for user like
        credit card, debit card and a user can also cancel ticket. This application also provides current position
        of train i.e. name of stations between which the train is currently running. It provides familiar and
        attractive interface with inserting and reporting capabilities.</p>
